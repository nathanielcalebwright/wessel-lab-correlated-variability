# wessel-lab-correlated-variability

This repository contains all code used to generate Figures 2 through 5 in our manuscript on membrane potential correlated variability.  The manuscript is currently under review.

To reproduce our results:
i) download all code, and maintain the organization of files and folders;
ii) save the directory (correlated_variability\) anywhere on your computer;
iii) update the 'master_folder_path' argument in the functions that generate publication figures (e.g., make_Fig2.py), to the full path of the correlated_variability folder (e.g., 'C:\\Users\\caleb\\Desktop\\correlated_variability');
iv) download the data used to generate results (to be made freely available soon!);
v) save the membrane potential recordings in the folder correlated_variability\downsampled_traces\, and the LFP recordings in the folder
correlated_variability\downsampled_LFP_traces\, maintaining the organization of the downloaded data;
v) call the functions that generate publication figures (e.g., make_Fig2.py).

This README will be updated upon publication of the manuscript, and when the data becomes available.
